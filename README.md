# class-redesigned
My name is Christa Ganz
This is a website for a New York City ELA teacher to update her class and keep all of the assignments together, during unprecedented times.
Using this website will be pretty straight forward and allows for the teacher and her students (and parents) to have all the information saved in one place to navigate.
Technologies used: html, css, JavaScript
Ideas for future improvement:
1. Include graphics (student or teacher created) to become even more visual as the year goes on. Similar to decorating a classroom throughout the year with student artwork and motivational quotes.
2. Allow for the students to publicly post their weekly accomplishments. Not their homework, but encouraging words for their fellow classmates to stay engaged.
3. A way for students to interact with their fellow classmates in real time (possibly a chat system), since they may not be getting the in-person socialization this year.
